TODO:

- Implement boundaryTable for faster overlap searches (chopping etc.)
- More tests for chopping, overlap searches
- Simplify the tests to essence (ask GPT for help)
- Review previous project for other niceties
- Production Build
- Maybe just switch to bun for all the bundling too instead of tsup
